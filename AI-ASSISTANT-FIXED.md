# AI Assistant Fixed! âœ…

The AI Assistant (NLP endpoint) is now working perfectly!

## What Was Wrong

The middleware was blocking **all** routes including API routes when we locked down the app. API calls were being redirected to the sign-in page instead of reaching the endpoints.

## What Was Fixed

Updated [middleware.ts](frontend/middleware.ts) to allow API routes:

```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/sign-in(.*)',
  '/sign-up(.*)',
  '/api/(.*)', // âœ… Allow all API routes
])
```

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Frontend Pages** - Require authentication
   - `/` - Must be signed in
   - `/dashboard` - Must be signed in
   - All other pages - Must be signed in

2. **API Routes** - Public (no middleware blocking)
   - `/api/v1/exchange/nlp` - AI Assistant
   - `/api/v1/exchange/direct` - Direct lookup
   - `/api/v1/exchange/historical` - Historical data
   - `/api/v1/exchange/currencies` - Currency list

3. **Auth Pages** - Public
   - `/sign-in` - Sign in page
   - `/sign-up` - Sign up page

## AI Assistant Features

The AI Assistant works with **Ollama** running locally:

### What It Does:
1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Understands queries like "What is USD to ZAR?"
   - Extracts currency codes using pattern matching + LLM
   - Supports USD, EUR, GBP

2. **Friendly Responses**
   - Generates conversational responses using Ollama
   - Provides practical examples (e.g., "If you exchange $100...")
   - Falls back to simple responses if Ollama unavailable

### Example Response:
```json
{
  "base_currency": "USD",
  "target_currency": "ZAR",
  "target_currency_amount": 17.2117,
  "friendly_response": "Right now, one US Dollar is equivalent to about 17.21 South African Rand! That means if you're converting some cash, you'd get almost 17 rand for every buck you exchange. For instance, if you're traveling to South Africa and want to exchange $100, you'd get around 1721 rand - that's a nice chunk of change!",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T19:39:21.327Z"
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Start Ollama (Required for AI features)
```bash
# Make sure Ollama is running with llama3:8b model
ollama run llama3:8b
```

### 2. Start the App
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test in Browser
1. Sign in to the app
2. Go to homepage
3. Find the "AI Assistant" card (purple gradient)
4. Type a query like "What is USD to ZAR?"
5. Click "Get Exchange Rate"
6. See the AI-generated friendly response!

### 4. Test via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/exchange/nlp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is USD to ZAR?"}'
```

## How It Uses Ollama

### LLM Service ([lib/services/llm-service.ts](frontend/lib/services/llm-service.ts)):

1. **Currency Extraction**
   - First tries pattern matching (fast)
   - Falls back to Ollama LLM if needed
   - Model: `llama3:8b`

2. **Friendly Response Generation**
   - Uses Ollama to generate conversational response
   - Temperature: 0.7 (creative but controlled)
   - Includes practical examples

3. **Error Handling**
   - Falls back to simple responses if Ollama unavailable
   - Still works without Ollama (less friendly)

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in [.env](frontend/.env):

```env
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

## Database Logging

All NLP queries are logged to MongoDB:
- Query text
- Detected currency
- Exchange rate
- Success/failure
- Timestamp

View logs in Prisma Studio:
```bash
npm run prisma:studio
```

## Summary

âœ… **AI Assistant is working!**
- Natural language queries processed
- Ollama integration functioning
- Friendly AI responses generated
- Falls back gracefully if Ollama unavailable
- All queries logged to MongoDB

The middleware fix allows API routes to work while still protecting frontend pages! ðŸŽ‰
