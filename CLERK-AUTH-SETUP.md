- Wrapped entire app with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Works alongside React Query provider

### 3. Sign-In & Sign-Up Pages
- Sign In: [app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx](frontend/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx)
- Sign Up: [app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx](frontend/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx)
- Beautiful branded pages with ZAR Exchange Hub styling
- Modal and page routing both supported

### 4. Header Component
- File: [components/header.tsx](frontend/components/header.tsx)
- Shows **UserButton** when signed in (avatar with dropdown)
- Shows **Sign In button** when signed out
- UserButton includes:
  - User profile
  - Account settings
  - Sign out option
  - Redirects to `/` after sign out

### 5. Sidebar Component
- File: [components/sidebar.tsx](frontend/components/sidebar.tsx)
- Shows **user info** at the bottom when signed in
  - Avatar
  - Full name
  - Email address
- Shows **Sign In button** when signed out
- Adapts to collapsed/expanded states
- Works on mobile and desktop

## How Authentication Works

### Public Routes
- `/` - Homepage (Exchange Rates) - Accessible to everyone
- `/sign-in` - Sign in page
- `/sign-up` - Sign up page
- All API routes

### Protected Routes
- `/dashboard` - Requires authentication
- Automatically redirects to `/sign-in` if not authenticated

### User Experience

#### When Signed Out:
1. Users see "Sign In" buttons in:
   - Header (top right)
   - Sidebar (bottom)
2. Clicking "Sign In" opens Clerk's modal or navigates to `/sign-in`
3. Users can sign in or create an account
4. After signing in, they're redirected back to where they were

#### When Signed In:
1. Users see their **avatar** in:
   - Header (top right) - Just avatar with dropdown
   - Sidebar (bottom) - Avatar + name + email
2. Clicking avatar opens Clerk's UserButton menu:
   - View profile
   - Manage account
   - **Sign out** (Clerk's built-in logout)
3. After signing out, redirects to homepage (`/`)

## Dashboard Protection

The dashboard is now **protected**:
```typescript
// middleware.ts
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect()
  }
})
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Add More Protected Routes
Edit [middleware.ts](frontend/middleware.ts):
```typescript
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/settings(.*)',
  '/profile(.*)',
])
```

### Customize Clerk Appearance
Update `appearance` prop in components:
```typescript
<UserButton
  appearance={{
    elements: {
      avatarBox: "h-9 w-9",
      userButtonPopoverCard: "border-emerald-500/20"
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Add User Data to API Calls
Access user info in API routes:
```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { userId } = await auth()
  // Use userId in database queries
}
```

### Setup Webhooks
Configure Clerk webhooks to sync user data to MongoDB when users sign up/update/delete.
